       "\"Lesson 1_Wealth Qi Lesson 1_Wealth Qi: [00:00:00] Hey everyone, this is Joey Yap . Welcome to the seven Figure Feng Shui Playbook Training Program. Welcome. Now, in this training we're gonna talk about. Certain wealth related formations in Feng Shui. So I'm gonna take you on a journey to understanding how you could apply certain Feng Shui setups to facilitate your goal in enhancing your career, your wealth opportunities, all from the perspective of. \\u200aFeng Shui applications. Okay. So of course the results will vary according to your Bazi and your efforts and your mindset and your, but let's try our best to improve our conditions no matter what. So when we say [00:01:00] seven figures. Basically we are referring to enhancing the capacity to improve your income. Now, to achieve that, we obviously will involve four specific aspects to work together in unison force to achieve this outcome, not just \\u200aFeng Shui . Okay, so these four aspects include Heaven, earth, man, and spirit. Heaven, earth man and spirit. Okay, so when we say timeliness, we are referring to things that are beyond our control, such as the market condition or the economy or the industry trends, for example. These are. To do with timing of external forces. When we call, when we talk about Heaven, earth, man, the man component or the human component refers to our efforts, our ideologies, right? Our mindset, heart set. Our energy level, [00:02:00] right? Our Bazi perspective because there are certain components in our Bazi , our destiny that we also have to understand and maximize a lot of people don't maximize their hidden potential and talents. And they go about life just doing the one thing that they know because. Culturally, or maybe through life experience. That's the only experience that they have, but the willingness to explore different possibilities and the willingness to make some mistakes at first while exploring is important. So the mindset and heartset is important. And then we talk about Feng Shui, which is the earth luck. This is where the component that we are addressing right now, which is how our environment plays a vital role in supporting our efforts in increasing our capacity to make a living and also to have a great lifestyle. Okay? And of course, the spiritual matters when our spirit realm [00:03:00] is aligned. We tend to become more intuitive. We make better decisions. We live a guided life, so these four realms play an extremely important role in determining our success. Now, having said that still we wanna apply the Feng Shui to maximize whatever potential that we have. Now, to do this, we must first understand how Feng Shui works. Feng Shui works based on the management and the enhancement of Qi. In fact, there are different types of Qi. Different types of energy fields. Qi basically is an invisible force that governs all our lives. It affects us from Heaven, earth, man, and even in the spiritual realm. It binds and connects all these four realms together. See it as a form of life force energy that. Pervades the universe. it permeates from the natural environment that surround us all the way to our [00:04:00] home where we live. Or where , the area where we work. Okay. So Qi itself is also divided to yin force and yang force and to five different elements. So the essence of life itself, that's what Qi about. It's. All living things have life force. All living things have Qi. It flows through humans, animals, plants, water into the spirit realm, into the earth realm, and anything that comes from. From our nature itself, it's that life force that qi. So you can see that Qi itself is also pure intelligence, a form of consciousness. So life force itself, the qi itself can be converted to willpower. It can be seen as the bonds between human beings and nature. Our emotions itself is also Qi, our energy, our stamina, [00:05:00] right? Our ability to think and our thoughts, our wellbeing. They're all part of this life force known as Qi Qi manifests itself. As our health, as our compassion and relationship and connection with other people, and more importantly, Qi manifest itself as our wealth. So by understanding, I. How to manage and enhance Qi. We can help us think better, have better thoughts sharpen our mind increase our courage, increase our capacity to love and be love, and to trust one another. So through the understanding of. The QI flow, we are able to enhance our wellbeing. So life force energy itself. QI itself has nine stages. Okay? Nine stages. So when a QI is really good, [00:06:00] then we are synchronized with. Nature. We're synchronized with flow. We're synchronized with our optimal performance, our peak performance. So I only have a look at these life force energy stages. These are more for from a layman's perspective, when we say Good Qi, good energy. What does it mean? Or we say bad energy, bad qi. Bad qi flow. What does it mean? How does it feel like? So at the lowest level, when the frequency of these life force energy, this Qi flow is low or in a negative form that's where, people feel pain, shame, and guilt when in a low form there's also a stage of denial and depression pain and generally unable to move forward as a form of either they are regression or they're hyperactive, right? For no reason, going on the wrong direction, [00:07:00] basically. Very confused. Very confused. Directionless, very lost. When people say I'm so lost, I don't know what to do. But they're not low in terms of activeness. They're very active pursuing one idea to another but always meet with failure and re and blockages and nothing seems to make progress. That's when the Qi is bad. So when the QI is good, right? Get better, you will improve in terms of the scale. So moving upwards, there's still this stage of fear and anger and resentment. Some people have anger with their job, their boss their colleagues, their parents, their resentment with their parents. There seem to be some childhood trauma, for example. All this. Causes paralysis, procrastination, and also regression. So this is not a good stage of QI to be in. So when we describe a [00:08:00] house or a property or the area that you work in has bad qi, this is the experience. That one is experiencing either pain, shame, guilt denial, blockage, depression, not moving forward, feeling lost, feeling angry, feeling resentment and fear. So in other words, I. How do you know that you are living in a place or working in a place, or staying in a place that has bad Qi? Do you feel these negative things? If you feel these negative forces like you're , continuously procrastinating, you are idling, not knowing what to do. You are, you have analysis paralysis, right? You overanalyze things, right? You are hyperactive or you are regressing. That's generally you are suffering from bad Qi You just don't, you don't know explicitly, but now you begin to, you realize, oh I'm at that level now. Conversely, if the [00:09:00] Qi is good. On a productive effect, you could be you have more courage, you have better reasoning, and you live life purposefully. So in this way, you know the opposite of feeling lost. You actually have, you are driven, right? You have you know what you want to do and what you want to achieve. There's a goal, there's a, commitment, there's a reason for doing what you do when you live life in that a mode. That means the Qi is good. The energy is driving. Life force energy itself wants to produce and keep life going, right? So the, there, there is always a drive to procreate. So that's life force itself. Okay? So courage and reasoning and purpose. If you live life like that, generally you're more fulfilled and happy. And if you go to a higher [00:10:00] level, you feel peace. You feel fulfilled, that's when you can perform at your peak. You don't have worries. You don't have this drama in life, right? You don't have this fear in you. So you know, whatever you do, you feel that, hey, this is what you're meant to do. And there's some internal peace. There's peace with your past. There's peace with other people, peace with in terms of all the challenges you met, and you understand that you're making progress. That's when you're performing at your peak and the highest level. That's when the Qi reaches to the highest level, helps someone become awakened. You're synchronized with nature. That's what we mean by harmonizing in nature, because we always say is about harmony. Okay, what are you harmonizing with? You're harmonizing with the flow of nature. You synchronize with growth. You synchronize your, life force itself. That means now life is happening for you and not to you anymore. So [00:11:00] there's a lot times people think that life is happening to me. I have this problem. You know this, all this bad luck that is happening. When you have all this bad luck, generally you are below that neutral level. You are in a anger, resentment, blockages, denial, depression, all this pain. When you have, when energy is good you are driven, you have a reason, right? You feel fulfilled, you are moving forward, you become awakened. That's when energy is good. So the idea of Feng Shui is to. Enhance your Qi level so that you could reach to the point of synchronicity. That's what we are trying to achieve. Okay. Now, when we are talking about a seven figure Feng Shui playbook, that means, in other words, it's a Feng Shui to enhance one's wellbeing and, wealth path. First, we have to understand. What is this wealth path, right? How do we actually achieve this [00:12:00] wealth in the first place? Okay, so let's look at this diagram right here. Everyone starts in life as. Students, right? Students, you some have formal education, some have very informal education. But in other, in, in any case, you have to learn things, right? Either you learn it on your own or you learn it from a school or learn it from experience. It's still, you gotta, it's, we are student of life. True. Alright, so we come out to the workforce and to generate our income for building our wealth. Now again, we are, you're in a wealth training program. In terms of Feng Shui, obviously we have to talk about a, wealth path, right? So some people who are extremely spiritual they are, oh it's all about the art. It's all about helping people. We don't talk about money. So if you're one of those right, then, it's very hard for you to get a wealth because you are repelling it from the start, right? 'cause you're not intentional about [00:13:00] building the wealth, which helps you with your mission. No wealth, no mission. I. You can't impact a lot of people without first being able to have the resources to be able to do that, right? A lot of spiritual people don't see that way, right? So that's why their impact is nominal. In order for you to make greater impact, you gotta have some resources. Resources to employ people, resources to build your dreams, to build a facility to help people. All this requires money. Okay, so from the students, from being a student, your first point of. First choice is to either be employed or become self-employed. Being employed means you're gonna get a job right after you graduate from school or some de graduate. But after being a student, you're gonna get an employment or you can employ yourself Right now, a lot of people think if I self-employed, I am a businessman or a businesswoman. Not really just self-employed. You're [00:14:00] employed by you. So the question is, are you a good boss? Here's the problem. You've never been a boss your whole life, right? So how do you know how to be a good boss or good leader? So being either you're self-employed or employed, you still have to learn to manage, operate, and lead. It's. Not something that you know, that just because you're born in a certain way, you become a good leader. You still have to make the mistakes. You still have to go through that process. If you have some people have the capacity to learn it faster. Some people learn it a bit slowly. Eventually you still have to learn it. Okay? So that's the path right now, after you operate, you know how to operate, manage, administrate. Business. Then there's a choice of whether or not you want to become a business owner. As an employee. Even as an employee, you're a professional, right? You've been working for other people [00:15:00] right along the way with through your skills, you learn to manage a team. You learn to operate a business. Eventually, you might wanna say, okay, I now gain enough experience to. And I wanna become a business owner. I wanna own my own business because simply if you own your own business, there's more leverage. As a business owner, there's more leverage than a person who is an employee. Okay? Now, it does not mean that being a professional employee earning income doesn't give you the leverage if you are working high enough. High top ranking, high level CEOs of multinational companies and multi-billion dollar companies also have the same freedom. Okay? But to get there, the path is actually steeper. Right way steeper. Whereas to get the freedom to expand and grow and have a, lifestyle, being a business owner offers that freedom at a possibly lower entry level. Okay? [00:16:00] Instead of working all the way to the top, of a multinational multi-billion dollar company. Alright? But either way, you still have to learn how to manage and operate. And if you wanna lead a, top level organization, you still have to think and act like a business owner, even though it's not your business. You might have shares in it, but you still have to think and act as a business owner. And the mindset, let me remind you that the mindset is very, different. A lot of employees will like to work the least and get paid the most, right? A lot of business owners will like to pay the lease and want the most outcome from their employees. Same thing, right? It's just. They are the mindset is very different, right? Business owners don't like holidays, public holidays 'cause they still have to pay their stuff, right? As an employee mindset, the more holidays, the better, right? Is to get paid anyway, right? So the, there's a difference, right? There's a difference between the mindset. So when you are going up. [00:17:00] That scale, that, that ladder, the mindset has to change. Those who can't change will remain an employee mindset. And an employee mindset will not enable you to lead and run an organization like a business owner for the shareholders. And so you are stuck. Right now, there's a reason why I'm explaining this to you because everyone's journey is different, and the way we deploy Feng Shui is to help us cross those barriers, right? To go from an employee to a business owner mindset. So we want to deploy Feng Shui to affect mindset. More than just affect luck itself. It's not the luck that you don't become a business owner. You don't become business because personality wise attitude wise and perception wise, you don't think, act and feel like one. And so you keep act and thinking and feel like an employee is very hard for you to take, go to the next level, right? So as a self employees, the same thing. [00:18:00] Just because you employ yourself doesn't mean you are a good manager. Doesn't mean you're a good leader, does not mean you operate well. You are self-employed. That's all that's the only difference. At some point, you still need to learn how to lead, how to look at finances, how to manage finances, how to operate, how to promote, how to, all those stuff. And then you become a good business owner because not everyone naturally can become a great business owner. They can own a business and still go bankrupt. So again, the Feng Shui that is deployed to help a self-employed to succeed may not always be activating wealth because that's what a normal person think. I activate the wealth luck. I need all my wealth stars activated. That only makes you more trouble and problems and more issues because maybe you are not unable to lead, unable to manage, unable to operate. There's a flaw that we didn't fix and that, that makes you a bad business [00:19:00] owner. So more business doesn't make your business succeed. You can't digest those business. That's could, that could be a problem as well. Okay, you learn I to be a good business owner, whether through and the employment route or the self-employed route, then there's a chance where you can become an entrepreneur. Now, an entrepreneur is very different than a business owner. An entrepreneur builds, looks at opportunities, builds the business for other people to invest in and participate in. You make other people money. You solve problems. You build up the business and you sell the business. You're not attached to the business. A business owner is pretty much working in the business and entrepreneur works on the business. It's very different. Okay, so where other people can start investing in you now, you're an entrepreneur. I. And ultimately, if you know how to do all this, you become a great investor as well because you understand how businesses [00:20:00] work. So Warren Buffett is good at what he does is because he understands how business works. I. That makes him a great investor. Okay. But here's the problem. A lot of people who are investing themselves are not good business owners. They're not good managers, they're not good operators. They're not very good at understanding how business works. So they become speculators and speculators lose more than they make. Okay? So that is the big problem. So when we say we use Feng Shui, we can't just. Activate speculation. Luck, right? While some might assist you in some speculative opportunities, but mostly it doesn't work that way. Function works to build up your peak performance. So you're gonna perform well in leadership management operation to own a business in, a way that you could build it, grow it, and become a better entrepreneur. You 10 x your wealth and you become an investor to also benefit from [00:21:00] other people's entrepreneurship. So that's the path. Alright. Now of course there's other shortcuts. Being a student, some people could just marry rich, right? So marry rich basically means you found a partner who has already. All this because of family background or because they're already there, right? They're already an entrepreneur or an investor. So you marry into the wealth. Again, this is a long shot, right? Not many people could do that. I. So we are not gonna talk about that sort of wealth path. We're gonna talk about the wealth path that most people would take in order to get to the highest level of a successful investor. So that's where your wealth could 10 x and quadruple and grow because now the money's working hard for you. Now here's the thing. Your Feng Shui application is different. For different [00:22:00] levels in this path. The problem is people think that is Feng Shui is a one size fit all, there is a wealth corner in the house. All you have to do is activate the wealth corner and everything will be all right. So that is too shallow. Okay. That's not a a, path towards building true wealth, although many people still think that no matter how many times I tell them, right? They will go there and say, okay, where's my wealth sector? Is it this wealth sector? Where should I put that or put a VA or put a tot or put some water? Ah, where's my money? Because they think that if I put water here by next Tuesday, a big chunk of money will come in. Okay? Because that's how most people have the impression of Feng Shui. Now, I want you to understand in true. Feng Shui for wealth, you have to build a wealth. Some will take longer time, some can be shorter. It depends on how fast you can go through these levels in this [00:23:00] path. Okay? That's what we're gonna talk about in this training program step by step to get to that outcome. So to begin your journey, you have to understand that when it comes to Qi itself for the building of wealth, we are gonna talk about wealth Qi. Now there's health Qi, there is relationship Qi, there's all different types of Qi. But when Qi related to wealth this is a term that, that, you know. Bridges, Metaphysics or Feng Shui with real world prosperity. Now, let's think about this. We always say that wealth is a form of energy. Life force Qi itself. So when we talk about wealth, we are obviously referring to having a lot of money and what do we call money? Money is currency and all currency is energy in motion. Hence wealth, Qi [00:24:00] is energy or life force energy itself. Currency equals current and current equals flow of energy. The word currency itself means to run, to flow, or to move. Latin and just like electric, current money is designed to move to circulate and exchange. So in Feng Shui, in metaphysical Feng Shui terms, this makes money a visible, tangible expression of an invisible energetic flow. That's why it is called Wealth Qi. Wealth Qi is like the energetic field that determines how, when and why wealth flows into and, through your life. And that's what Feng Shui for wealth. It's about. It's not just about having money, it's about having the power to attract to hold and multiply [00:25:00] value. So wealth Qi is, not. It's not merely about how much money in the bank, alright, or how to increase your income per dollar per, for example. It's not like that. All right? I just want you to understand that if you are hoping that's the case, it's not. All right. Lemme tell you that wealth is the energetic frequency of abundance. So when we say we enhance wealth in this training. We are talking about enhancing abundance, about enhancing the ability, the ideation of value creation. That means that you wanna make more money, you have to create more value for people. Okay. And we understand how energy ideas flow into your life. It is the quality and direction of, life force energy, meaning Qi that governs your capacity to receive, retain, and multiply your wealth. So not just in currency, but indeed. Opportunities [00:26:00] in the resources and the influence in your life. So when we say wealth Qi it's the Qi, it's the energy force that draws wealth opportunities toward you, whether through people, through timing, through your strategy, your effort, your planning or space. Just like wind carries seeds and water nourishes roots, wealth Qi is the. Energetic current, that either circulates freely or stagnate based on your alignment in that Feng Shui setup that you have in your home or your office. Okay, so now when we say the Yin and yang of Wealth Qi, what are we referring to? We're referring that yang wealth is active income. It's bold, it's outward, it's strategic, it's found in deals it's visible, right? Visibility as a, as your your. Job or your title or your, whatever you're [00:27:00] doing. If you're visible to people, look for you. Hustle your expansion. That's outward, right? When we say yin, that we are referring to passive income influence magnetism, right? Your charisma your, wise positioning, and it, arrives to you through resonance and not true force. That's the difference between yin and yang. Okay? So when we, look at Feng Shui charts, there's a yin side and a yang side of a Feng Shui chart. So when we put these templates, which you'll be learning later on onto your room, your house, and all that, we understand. So what are we looking for? Are we looking for active for or passive? What sort of wealth are we looking for? So we are breaking it down to that detail. So you must understand that Feng Shui master of chief role. Does not chase this qi. The function master of wealth Qi [00:28:00] cultivates, aligns and lets wealth Qi arrive just like the mist upon mountain. That's what you want to do. That's what we call Qi accumulation in a property. So in Chinese we call that means to 聚 气 , 聚 to accumulate the QI in a certain place. So the entire premise of function is called 藏 风 聚 气 means you want to. Collect the Wind and formulate the qi in a certain position. In other words, we are gathering, we're cultivating a aligning wealth. QI. That's the function of Feng Shui practice. Or if a practitioner does Feng Shui alignment, we're basically doing this. Okay, so yang wealth Qi is movement, transactions, expansion, deal making, right? It's active, masculine, expressive, yin wealth. Qi, on the other hand is, [00:29:00] receptivity. It's value accumulation. It's nurturing and growing your assets. It's attraction, it is intuition. It's passive, it's magnetic by nature. Okay. But of course when a, setup is too yang. When it's too yang, it causes burnout and aggressive losses, rapid losses. When it's too yin, it leads to stagnation and missed chances. So you don't want a formation to be too yang or too yin Now, too yang or too yin does not mean it's too bright or too di. Alright? The, impression the most we have is, oh, I have too much sunlight. It's too Yang. No, too Yang or too Yin. Have to be based on the stars or the star chart of your house, okay? There's a calculation of how the qi is yang or yin. It's not based on how bright or dim your places, right? So now. Of course we say we look for a balance, right? If you could balance the yin and yang in a way, balance the type of Qi in [00:30:00] in a positive way, in such a way, just like an investor who knows when to act and when to wait, then you will have mastered wealth generation. Okay? Now. You have to understand that wealth, energy or wealth Qi abides by follows the law of circulation, meaning qi must flow to grow. Write this down. Qi must flow to grow. Okay? That's why we say in Feng Shui formations means you must be moving, must be unobstructed. This basic Feng Shui 1 0 1. Okay, so Qi like money must flow right? You, when you hoard, when you fear and you resist, you block the natural movement of energy. But when you give, you invest, you build value, you amplify it. That's how wealth Qi works. [00:31:00] So in, in, our, in Feng Shui principles, Qi. Stagnates when there are blockages in your home. Extreme cluttered spaces, there's, these are equal to block meridians and in an unaligned timing. So when that happens, Gen Qi stagnates and then your life stagnates. So you know, when you understand your Qi flow. Remember, Qi flow or wealth Qi is your servant. It is not a master, right? You do not pray to wealth. You deploy it, right? When you deploy it with intent, you create expansion and growth, and that's how wealth energy works. So you have to understand that your wealth outcome like your money image mirrors your internal Qi flow. Now, if your internal energy fuel. [00:32:00] What is your internal energy, your internal mind, heart, heartset mindset, self-worth, emotions, decisions? All those are your internal energy flow. If this feel is scattered, is anxious, is fearful, then your external wealth reality will just reflect exactly that. But if there's an energetic alignment. With your internal Qi, self-worth, emotions decision making capacity will be centered, focus, and courageous. Your external wealth will also reflect that reality, and that's what Feng Shui is about. When we say we deploy Feng Shui, we have to match that with your internal energy mapping as well. So in order to align your internal g internal energy mapping, we have to understand your life gua and or your birth data your Bazi chart. Once we understand that part, [00:33:00] and we align it energetically, now we'll have. The building of, external wealth. That's why true wealth begins with energetic alignment. True wealth doesn't begin with your bank account. It begins your energetic alignment and wealth. When enhanced, it's the frequency of trust, self-worth of your ability to create value, your contribution, and more importantly, flow, right? So you wanna think yourself and your home, like the radio, right? You only receive frequency that you're tuned into. So wealth Qi is the station of abundance. When you can tune into that, you gain abundance. Okay, so that's what wealth Qi is, about. So now there are different types of elements for the wealth Qi, right? Different types of elements. So when we say certain element like wood for [00:34:00] example, wood money comes from vision creation and scaling because that's wood is about, growth. If your wealth element in terms of your house is fire structure, right? Money flows from passion, charisma, branding, this is a wealth, is influence. That's fire element because brightness, right? Or if your wealth structure of the house we're talking about, the Feng Shui formation is earth. Now I'm not talking about your personal element, guys, in case you get confused. Oh, are you talking my personal element? No, I'm not. I'm talking about your house houses Feng Shui structure. We'll come to that. Okay, now I'll just give you a big picture, right? So suppose your earth element your house houses earth is your wealth. Then your wealth comes through stability and longevity. For example, money in that comes from assets like land through systems, through residual income, through trust funds, for example. That's consistency. [00:35:00] If your money structure, your wealth structure is metal, then metal is value, right? Money is positioned structured financial instruments from order, right? For that's, what the metal wealth, right from funds, for example. That's metal or the structure of water. Now, water, that means your wealth comes through flow. That means money is in the form of ideas, connections, network, and adaptability. Okay, so the way Feng Shui works is you will find that in this training is that wealth Qi in Feng Shui flows through main door alignment. Okay, so one of the most important thing is adjustments of main door. Now, I know this is not always practical 'cause not many people can adjust their main door, right? So then what is the Subsid subsequent thing we look for? We look for wealth sectors. Now, wealth sector is not [00:36:00] one sector. It could be different areas in the home that governs different types of wealth. So if you cannot adjust the main door, we'll adjust the wealth sectors in the house, obviously through Qi mapping. I'll explain how this Qi mapping works and of course, the capacity of whether you can break seven figures or eight figures or nine figures totally depend on the net natural environment, which consists of the incoming dragon and mountain formations in the nearby facility. Okay? And then an obstructed flow means that no blockages. From the external environment to you. Therefore, the capacity to grow is huge. Alright? So if there's obstructions, obviously that limits the opportunities coming to you. Alright? Now, in order to cultivate wealth Qi, before you even begin your training, it's important to first clarify what your [00:37:00] value is. What your true value is because you are no value or you don't know your value. At, first of all, people don't know their value. What should I do? What should I do? I don't know what I'm good at. If you're one of those people right, then you know Qi flows where there is purpose. You must first define how you serve and create and what value you are adding. I have seen people, young people say, Hey I'm due for increment. What do you mean you're due for increment? You. You are paid to do a job. You did the jobs. Therefore, that's it, right? But no, I'm entitled to increment because I work three to four months. That sort of mentality is a problem. That's what's your value, right? So you should Feng Shui your brain first, right? You should Feng Shui your alignment to what true value is. So I'm not saying a majority of people like that. So some people at the younger generation, they probably don't see this. And so you have to first define and clarify your true value because when you are using Feng Shui to enhance your income. It is helping [00:38:00] you. It flows better when there is purpose, right? So if you don't know what your purpose and true value is, it's very hard to use Feng Shui to enhance you. 'cause sometimes people are just there trying to make a quick bump. I've seen people like that, right? Then there's this the second thing you need to do is unblock the flow. You need to remove the internal resistance first. There could be sphere fear, scarcity, mindset, and probably a lot of external stagnations. Like for example, you have a lot of old stuff in the house, lot of old boxes and clutter that sort of blocks the flow in Feng Shui, your internal blocks and external blocks that you should. First remove. Okay? Because once you understand that flowing or QI requires flowing of the environment, it's easier to adjust your Feng Shui. Okay? Now we will be talking about aligning alignment with timing [00:39:00] because there's such thing called annual stars in Feng Shui that not every year is processed, but certain years, certain energies at its peak. To align with timing means you need to also take action at those times. If it doesn't, ma, if Feng Shui doesn't match your actual actions in life, you can't benefit from the Feng Shui. You have to take action, okay? And you gotta stay in motion. Qi dies when you stop growing. So keep learning, keep moving, keep creating. A lot of people don't improve themselves. They're, in the job and they're wondering, why don't we get a promotion? The reason you don't get a promotion is because your knowledge state the same Qi dies when you stop growing. So keep learning, keep moving, keep creating. I've seen people young, 21 years old, driven keep on improving and they make a lot of money. 21 to 25. I've seen people at 35 years old making very low [00:40:00] income and they're wondering why they don't get promoted. Only because you ask them. Yeah. How many books do you read? I don't read anything. How do you get knowledge? Oh, I just look at Facebook. So can you understand the, problem that a lot of people don't see where their problem is? So Qi dies when you stop growing. Remember that no matter what you try to activate in Feng Shui. You can activate until the cows come home. But the function will not affect you, only because your internal Qi has died. You stop growing. Okay? And fifth thing is you wanna harmonize with other people, right? Harmonize with others. Wealth, multiplies true connections, relationships, not isolation. Okay? We're designed to live together with people. Think about this. All success comes from the help of other people. Okay. It comes from the help of other people. It [00:41:00] doesn't come because only you did your job. Other people participated in your success. Always remember that. So wealth multiplies when you connect with other people. Okay? So wealth Qi is not something you pursue, it's something that you. You magnetize towards you when your Qi and outer environment are in harmony, especially with the heavens timing, right? All opportunities will flow to you. That's what we are focusing on. Alright, so the internal state, the external space, the timing, and behavioral patterns all disconnect. You will turn. Bad luck to Good luck. All right, so now you understand what Wealth Qi is. Review this lesson. Make sure you understand all this component about what wealth Qi is and when you're ready. I'll see you in the next lesson. \""

      "Lesson 1_Wealth Qi Lesson 1_Wealth Qi: [00:00:00] Hey everyone, this is Joey Yap . Welcome to the seven Figure Feng Shui Playbook Training Program. Welcome. Now, in this training we're gonna talk about. Certain wealth related formations in Feng Shui. So I'm gonna take you on a journey to understanding how you could apply certain Feng Shui setups to facilitate your goal in enhancing your career, your wealth opportunities, all from the perspective of.  Feng Shui applications. Okay. So of course the results will vary according to your Bazi and your efforts and your mindset and your, but let's try our best to improve our conditions no matter what. So when we say [00:01:00] seven figures. Basically we are referring to enhancing the capacity to improve your income. Now, to achieve that, we obviously will involve four specific aspects to work together in unison force to achieve this outcome, not just  Feng Shui . Okay, so these four aspects include Heaven, earth, man, and spirit. Heaven, earth man and spirit. Okay, so when we say timeliness, we are referring to things that are beyond our control, such as the market condition or the economy or the industry trends, for example. These are. To do with timing of external forces. When we call, when we talk about Heaven, earth, man, the man component or the human component refers to our efforts, our ideologies, right? Our mindset, heart set. Our energy level, [00:02:00] right? Our Bazi perspective because there are certain components in our Bazi , our destiny that we also have to understand and maximize a lot of people don't maximize their hidden potential and talents. And they go about life just doing the one thing that they know because. Culturally, or maybe through life experience. That's the only experience that they have, but the willingness to explore different possibilities and the willingness to make some mistakes at first while exploring is important. So the mindset and heartset is important. And then we talk about Feng Shui, which is the earth luck. This is where the component that we are addressing right now, which is how our environment plays a vital role in supporting our efforts in increasing our capacity to make a living and also to have a great lifestyle. Okay? And of course, the spiritual matters when our spirit realm [00:03:00] is aligned. We tend to become more intuitive. We make better decisions. We live a guided life, so these four realms play an extremely important role in determining our success. Now, having said that still we wanna apply the Feng Shui to maximize whatever potential that we have. Now, to do this, we must first understand how Feng Shui works.\n",

It flows through humans, animals, plants, water into the spirit realm, into the earth realm, and anything that comes from. From our nature itself, it's that life force that qi. So you can see that Qi itself is also pure intelligence, a form of consciousness. So life force itself, the qi itself can be converted to willpower. It can be seen as the bonds between human beings and nature. Our emotions itself is also Qi, our energy, our stamina, [00:05:00] right? Our ability to think and our thoughts, our wellbeing.

      "QI itself has nine stages. Okay? Nine stages. So when a QI is really good, [00:06:00] then we are synchronized with. Nature. We're synchronized with flow. We're synchronized with our optimal performance, our peak performance. So I only have a look at these life force energy stages. These are more for from a layman's perspective, when we say Good Qi, good energy. What does it mean? Or we say bad energy, bad qi. Bad qi flow. What does it mean? How does it feel like? So at the lowest level, when the frequency of these life force energy, this Qi flow is low or in a negative form that's where, people feel pain, shame, and guilt when in a low form there's also a stage of denial and depression pain and generally unable to move forward as a form of either they are regression or they're hyperactive, right? For no reason, going on the wrong direction, [00:07:00] basically. Very confused. Very confused. Directionless, very lost. When people say I'm so lost, I don't know what to do. But they're not low in terms of activeness. They're very active pursuing one idea to another but always meet with failure and re and blockages and nothing seems to make progress. That's when the Qi is bad. So when the QI is good, right? Get better, you will improve in terms of the scale. So moving upwards, there's still this stage of fear and anger and resentment. Some people have anger with their job, their boss their colleagues, their parents, their resentment with their parents. There seem to be some childhood trauma, for example. All this. Causes paralysis, procrastination, and also regression. So this is not a good stage of QI to be in. So when we describe a [00:08:00] house or a property or the area that you work in has bad qi, this is the experience. That one is experiencing either pain, shame, guilt denial, blockage, depression, not moving forward, feeling lost, feeling angry, feeling resentment and fear. So in other words, I. How do you know that you are living in a place or working in a place, or staying in a place that has bad Qi? Do you feel these negative things? If you feel these negative forces like you're , continuously procrastinating, you are idling, not knowing what to do. You are, you have analysis paralysis, right? You overanalyze things, right? You are hyperactive or you are regressing. That's generally you are suffering from bad Qi You just don't, you don't know explicitly, but now you begin to, you realize, oh I'm at that level now. Conversely, if the [00:09:00] Qi is good. On a productive effect, you could be you have more courage, you have better reasoning, and you live life purposefully. So in this way, you know the opposite of feeling lost. You actually have, you are driven, right? You have you know what you want to do and what you want to achieve. There's a goal, there's a, commitment, there's a reason for doing what you do when you live life in that a mode. That means the Qi is good. The energy is driving. Life force energy itself wants to produce and keep life going, right? So the, there, there is always a drive to procreate. So that's life force itself. Okay? So courage and reasoning and purpose. If you live life like that, generally you're more fulfilled and happy. And if you go to a higher [00:10:00] level, you feel peace. You feel fulfilled, that's when you can perform at your peak. You don't have worries. You don't have this drama in life, right? You don't have this fear in you. So you know, whatever you do, you feel that, hey, this is what you're meant to do. And there's some internal peace. There's peace with your past. There's peace with other people, peace with in terms of all the challenges you met, and you understand that you're making progress. That's when you're performing at your peak and the highest level. That's when the Qi reaches to the highest level, helps someone become awakened. You're synchronized with nature. That's what we mean by harmonizing in nature, because we always say is about harmony. Okay, what are you harmonizing with? You're harmonizing with the flow of nature. You synchronize with growth. You synchronize your, life force itself. That means now life is happening for you and not to you anymore. So [00:11:00] there's a lot times people think that life is happening to me. I have this problem. You know this, all this bad luck that is happening. When you have all this bad luck, generally you are below that neutral level. You are in a anger, resentment, blockages, denial, depression, all this pain. When you have, when energy is good you are driven, you have a reason, right? You feel fulfilled, you are moving forward, you become awakened. That's when energy is good. So the idea of Feng Shui is to. Enhance your Qi level so that you could reach to the point of synchronicity. That's what we are trying to achieve. Okay. Now, when we are talking about a seven figure Feng Shui playbook, that means, in other words, it's a Feng Shui to enhance one's wellbeing and, wealth path. First, we have to understand. What is this wealth path, right? How do we actually achieve this [00:12:00] wealth in the first place? Okay, so\n",

      "let's look at this diagram right here. Everyone starts in life as. Students, right? Students, you some have formal education, some have very informal education. But in other, in, in any case, you have to learn things, right? Either you learn it on your own or you learn it from a school or learn it from experience. It's still, you gotta, it's, we are student of life. True. Alright, so we come out to the workforce and to generate our income for building our wealth. Now again, we are, you're in a wealth training program. In terms of Feng Shui, obviously we have to talk about a, wealth path, right? So some people who are extremely spiritual they are, oh it's all about the art. It's all about helping people. We don't talk about money. So if you're one of those right, then, it's very hard for you to get a wealth because you are repelling it from the start, right? 'cause you're not intentional about [00:13:00] building the wealth, which helps you with your mission. No wealth, no mission. I. You can't impact a lot of people without first being able to have the resources to be able to do that, right? A lot of spiritual people don't see that way, right? So that's why their impact is nominal. In order for you to make greater impact, you gotta have some resources. Resources to employ people, resources to build your dreams, to build a facility to help people. All this requires money. Okay, so from the students, from being a student, your first point of. First choice is to either be employed or become self-employed. Being employed means you're gonna get a job right after you graduate from school or some de graduate. But after being a student, you're gonna get an employment or you can employ yourself Right now, a lot of people think if I self-employed, I am a businessman or a businesswoman. Not really just self-employed. You're [00:14:00] employed by you. So the question is, are you a good boss? Here's the problem. You've never been a boss your whole life, right? So how do you know how to be a good boss or good leader? So being either you're self-employed or employed, you still have to learn to manage, operate, and lead. It's. Not something that you know, that just because you're born in a certain way, you become a good leader. You still have to make the mistakes. You still have to go through that process. If you have some people have the capacity to learn it faster. Some people learn it a bit slowly. Eventually you still have to learn it. Okay? So that's the path right now, after you operate, you know how to operate, manage, administrate. Business. Then there's a choice of whether or not you want to become a business owner. As an employee. Even as an employee, you're a professional, right? You've been working for other people [00:15:00] right along the way with through your skills, you learn to manage a team. You learn to operate a business. Eventually, you might wanna say, okay, I now gain enough experience to. And I wanna become a business owner. I wanna own my own business because simply if you own your own business, there's more leverage. As a business owner, there's more leverage than a person who is an employee. Okay? Now, it does not mean that being a professional employee earning income doesn't give you the leverage if you are working high enough. High top ranking, high level CEOs of multinational companies and multi-billion dollar companies also have the same freedom. Okay? But to get there, the path is actually steeper. Right way steeper. Whereas to get the freedom to expand and grow and have a, lifestyle, being a business owner offers that freedom at a possibly lower entry level. Okay? [00:16:00] Instead of working all the way to the top, of a multinational multi-billion dollar company. Alright? But either way, you still have to learn how to manage and operate. And if you wanna lead a, top level organization, you still have to think and act like a business owner, even though it's not your business. You might have shares in it, but you still have to think and act as a business owner. And the mindset, let me remind you that the mindset is very, different. A lot of employees will like to work the least and get paid the most, right? A lot of business owners will like to pay the lease and want the most outcome from their employees. Same thing, right? It's just. They are the mindset is very different, right? Business owners don't like holidays, public holidays 'cause they still have to pay their stuff, right? As an employee mindset, the more holidays, the better, right? Is to get paid anyway, right? So the, there's a difference, right? There's a difference between the mindset. So when you are going up. [00:17:00] That scale, that, that ladder, the mindset has to change. Those who can't change will remain an employee mindset. And an employee mindset will not enable you to lead and run an organization like a business owner for the shareholders. And so you are stuck. Right now, there's a reason why I'm explaining this to you because everyone's journey is different, and the way we deploy Feng Shui is to help us cross those barriers, right? To go from an employee to a business owner mindset. So we want to deploy Feng Shui to affect mindset. More than just affect luck itself. It's not the luck that you don't become a business owner. You don't become business because personality wise attitude wise and perception wise, you don't think, act and feel like one. And so you keep act and thinking and feel like an employee is very hard for you to take, go to the next level, right? So as a self employees, the same thing. [00:18:00] Just because you employ yourself doesn't mean you are a good manager. Doesn't mean you're a good leader, does not mean you operate well. You are self-employed. That's all that's the only difference. At some point, you still need to learn how to lead, how to look at finances, how to manage finances, how to operate, how to promote, how to, all those stuff. And then you become a good business owner because not everyone naturally can become a great business owner. They can own a business and still go bankrupt. So again, the Feng Shui that is deployed to help a self-employed to succeed may not always be activating wealth because that's what a normal person think. I activate the wealth luck. I need all my wealth stars activated. That only makes you more trouble and problems and more issues because maybe you are not unable to lead, unable to manage, unable to operate. There's a flaw that we didn't fix and that, that makes you a bad business [00:19:00] owner. So more business doesn't make your business succeed. You can't digest those business. That's could, that could be a problem as well. Okay, you learn I to be a good business owner, whether through and the employment route or the self-employed route, then there's a chance where you can become an entrepreneur. Now, an entrepreneur is very different than a business owner. An entrepreneur builds, looks at opportunities, builds the business for other people to invest in and participate in. You make other people money. You solve problems. You build up the business and you sell the business. You're not attached to the business. A business owner is pretty much working in the business and entrepreneur works on the business. It's very different. Okay, so where other people can start investing in you now, you're an entrepreneur. I. And ultimately, if you know how to do all this, you become a great investor as well because you understand how businesses [00:20:00] work. So Warren Buffett is good at what he does is because he understands how business works. I. That makes him a great investor. Okay. But here's the problem. A lot of people who are investing themselves are not good business owners. They're not good managers, they're not good operators. They're not very good at understanding how business works. So they become speculators and speculators lose more than they make. Okay? So that is the big problem. So when we say we use Feng Shui, we can't just. Activate speculation. Luck, right? While some might assist you in some speculative opportunities, but mostly it doesn't work that way. Function works to build up your peak performance. So you're gonna perform well in leadership management operation to own a business in, a way that you could build it, grow it, and become a better entrepreneur. You 10 x your wealth and you become an investor to also benefit from [00:21:00] other people's entrepreneurship. So that's the path. Alright. Now of course there's other shortcuts. Being a student, some people could just marry rich, right? So marry rich basically means you found a partner who has already. All this because of family background or because they're already there, right? They're already an entrepreneur or an investor. So you marry into the wealth. Again, this is a long shot, right? Not many people could do that. I. So we are not gonna talk about that sort of wealth path. We're gonna talk about the wealth path that most people would take in order to get to the highest level of a successful investor. So that's where your wealth could 10 x and quadruple and grow because now the money's working hard for you. Now here's the thing. Your Feng Shui application is different. For different [00:22:00] levels in this path. The problem is people think that is Feng Shui is a one size fit all, there is a wealth corner in the house. All you have to do is activate the wealth corner and everything will be all right. So that is too shallow. Okay. That's not a a, path towards building true wealth, although many people still think that no matter how many times I tell them, right? They will go there and say, okay, where's my wealth sector? Is it this wealth sector? Where should I put that or put a VA or put a tot or put some water? Ah, where's my money? Because they think that if I put water here by next Tuesday, a big chunk of money will come in. Okay? Because that's how most people have the impression of Feng Shui. Now, I want you to understand in true. Feng Shui for wealth, you have to build a wealth. Some will take longer time, some can be shorter. It depends on how fast you can go through these levels in this [00:23:00] path. Okay? That's what we're gonna talk about in this training program step by step to get to that outcome. So to begin your journey, you have to understand that when it comes to Qi itself for the building of wealth,\n",

      "we are gonna talk about wealth Qi. Now there's health Qi, there is relationship Qi, there's all different types of Qi. But when Qi related to wealth this is a term that, that, you know. Bridges, Metaphysics or Feng Shui with real world prosperity. Now, let's think about this. We always say that wealth is a form of energy. Life force Qi itself. So when we talk about wealth, we are obviously referring to having a lot of money and what do we call money? Money is currency and all currency is energy in motion. Hence wealth, Qi [00:24:00] is energy or life force energy itself. Currency equals current and current equals flow of energy. The word currency itself means to run, to flow, or to move. Latin and just like electric, current money is designed to move to circulate and exchange. So in Feng Shui, in metaphysical Feng Shui terms, this makes money a visible, tangible expression of an invisible energetic flow. That's why it is called Wealth Qi. Wealth Qi is like the energetic field that determines how, when and why wealth flows into and, through your life. And that's what Feng Shui for wealth. It's about. It's not just about having money, it's about having the power to attract to hold and multiply [00:25:00] value. So wealth Qi is, not. It's not merely about how much money in the bank, alright, or how to increase your income per dollar per, for example. It's not like that. All right? I just want you to understand that if you are hoping that's the case, it's not. All right. Lemme tell you that wealth is the energetic frequency of abundance. So when we say we enhance wealth in this training. We are talking about enhancing abundance, about enhancing the ability, the ideation of value creation. That means that you wanna make more money, you have to create more value for people. Okay. And we understand how energy ideas flow into your life. It is the quality and direction of, life force energy, meaning Qi that governs your capacity to receive, retain, and multiply your wealth. So not just in currency, but indeed. Opportunities [00:26:00] in the resources and the influence in your life. So when we say wealth Qi it's the Qi, it's the energy force that draws wealth opportunities toward you, whether through people, through timing, through your strategy, your effort, your planning or space. Just like wind carries seeds and water nourishes roots, wealth Qi is the. Energetic current, that either circulates freely or stagnate based on your alignment in that Feng Shui setup that you have in your home or your office. Okay, so now when we say\n",

      "the Yin and yang of Wealth Qi, what are we referring to? We're referring that yang wealth is active income. It's bold, it's outward, it's strategic, it's found in deals it's visible, right? Visibility as a, as your your. Job or your title or your, whatever you're [00:27:00] doing. If you're visible to people, look for you. Hustle your expansion. That's outward, right? When we say yin, that we are referring to passive income influence magnetism, right? Your charisma your, wise positioning, and it, arrives to you through resonance and not true force. That's the difference between yin and yang. Okay? So when we, look at Feng Shui charts, there's a yin side and a yang side of a Feng Shui chart. So when we put these templates, which you'll be learning later on onto your room, your house, and all that, we understand. So what are we looking for? Are we looking for active for or passive? What sort of wealth are we looking for? So we are breaking it down to that detail. So you must understand that Feng Shui master of chief role. Does not chase this qi. The function master of wealth Qi [00:28:00] cultivates, aligns and lets wealth Qi arrive just like the mist upon mountain. That's what you want to do. That's what we call Qi accumulation in a property. So in Chinese we call that means to 聚 气 , 聚 to accumulate the QI in a certain place. So the entire premise of function is called 藏 风 聚 气 means you want to. Collect the Wind and formulate the qi in a certain position. In other words, we are gathering, we're cultivating a aligning wealth. QI. That's the function of Feng Shui practice. Or if a practitioner does Feng Shui alignment, we're basically doing this. Okay, so yang wealth Qi is movement, transactions, expansion, deal making, right? It's active, masculine, expressive, yin wealth. Qi, on the other hand is, [00:29:00] receptivity. It's value accumulation. It's nurturing and growing your assets. It's attraction, it is intuition. It's passive, it's magnetic by nature. Okay. But of course when a, setup is too yang. When it's too yang, it causes burnout and aggressive losses, rapid losses. When it's too yin, it leads to stagnation and missed chances. So you don't want a formation to be too yang or too yin Now, too yang or too yin does not mean it's too bright or too di. Alright? The, impression the most we have is, oh, I have too much sunlight. It's too Yang. No, too Yang or too Yin. Have to be based on the stars or the star chart of your house, okay? There's a calculation of how the qi is yang or yin. It's not based on how bright or dim your places, right? So now. Of course we say we look for a balance, right? If you could balance the yin and yang in a way, balance the type of Qi in [00:30:00] in a positive way, in such a way, just like an investor who knows when to act and when to wait, then you will have mastered wealth generation. Okay? Now. You have to understand that wealth, energy or wealth Qi abides by follows the law of circulation, meaning\n",

      "qi must flow to grow. Write this down. Qi must flow to grow. Okay? That's why we say in Feng Shui formations means you must be moving, must be unobstructed. This basic Feng Shui 1 0 1. Okay, so Qi like money must flow right? You, when you hoard, when you fear and you resist, you block the natural movement of energy. But when you give, you invest, you build value, you amplify it. That's how wealth Qi works. [00:31:00] So in, in, our, in Feng Shui principles, Qi. Stagnates when there are blockages in your home. Extreme cluttered spaces, there's, these are equal to block meridians and in an unaligned timing. So when that happens, Gen Qi stagnates and then your life stagnates. So you know, when you understand your Qi flow. Remember, Qi flow or\n",

      "wealth Qi is your servant. It is not a master, right? You do not pray to wealth. You deploy it, right? When you deploy it with intent, you create expansion and growth, and that's how wealth energy works. So you have to understand that\n",

      "your wealth outcome like your money image mirrors your internal Qi flow. Now, if your internal energy fuel. [00:32:00] What is your internal energy, your internal mind, heart, heartset mindset, self-worth, emotions, decisions? All those are your internal energy flow. If this feel is scattered, is anxious, is fearful, then your external wealth reality will just reflect exactly that. But if there's an energetic alignment. With your internal Qi, self-worth, emotions decision making capacity will be centered, focus, and courageous. Your external wealth will also reflect that reality, and that's what Feng Shui is about. When we say we deploy Feng Shui, we have to match that with your internal energy mapping as well. So in order to align your internal g internal energy mapping, we have to understand your life gua and or your birth data your Bazi chart. Once we understand that part, [00:33:00] and we align it energetically, now we'll have. The building of, external wealth. That's why true wealth begins with energetic alignment. True wealth doesn't begin with your bank account. It begins your energetic alignment and wealth. When enhanced, it's the frequency of trust, self-worth of your ability to create value, your contribution, and more importantly, flow, right? So you wanna think yourself and your home, like the radio, right? You only receive frequency that you're tuned into. So wealth Qi is the station of abundance. When you can tune into that, you gain abundance. Okay, so that's what wealth Qi is, about. So now there are\n",

      "different types of elements for the wealth Qi, right? Different types of elements. So when we say certain element like wood for [00:34:00] example, wood money comes from vision creation and scaling because that's wood is about, growth. If your wealth element in terms of your house is fire structure, right? Money flows from passion, charisma, branding, this is a wealth, is influence. That's fire element because brightness, right? Or if your wealth structure of the house we're talking about, the Feng Shui formation is earth. Now I'm not talking about your personal element, guys, in case you get confused. Oh, are you talking my personal element? No, I'm not. I'm talking about your house houses Feng Shui structure. We'll come to that. Okay, now I'll just give you a big picture, right? So suppose your earth element your house houses earth is your wealth. Then your wealth comes through stability and longevity. For example, money in that comes from assets like land through systems, through residual income, through trust funds, for example. That's consistency. [00:35:00] If your money structure, your wealth structure is metal, then metal is value, right? Money is positioned structured financial instruments from order, right? For that's, what the metal wealth, right from funds, for example. That's metal or the structure of water. Now, water, that means your wealth comes through flow. That means money is in the form of ideas, connections, network, and adaptability. Okay, so the way Feng Shui works is you will find that in this training is that wealth Qi in Feng Shui flows through main door alignment. Okay, so one of the most important thing is adjustments of main door. Now, I know this is not always practical 'cause not many people can adjust their main door, right? So then what is the Subsid subsequent thing we look for? We look for wealth sectors. Now, wealth sector is not [00:36:00] one sector. It could be different areas in the home that governs different types of wealth. So if you cannot adjust the main door, we'll adjust the wealth sectors in the house, obviously through Qi mapping. I'll explain how this Qi mapping works and of course, the capacity of whether you can break seven figures or eight figures or nine figures totally depend on the net natural environment, which consists of the incoming dragon and mountain formations in the nearby facility. Okay? And then an obstructed flow means that no blockages. From the external environment to you. Therefore, the capacity to grow is huge. Alright? So if there's obstructions, obviously that limits the opportunities coming to you. Alright? Now,\n",

      "in order to cultivate wealth Qi, before you even begin your training, it's important to first clarify what your [00:37:00] value is. What your true value is because you are no value or you don't know your value. At, first of all, people don't know their value. What should I do? What should I do? I don't know what I'm good at. If you're one of those people right, then you know Qi flows where there is purpose. You must first define how you serve and create and what value you are adding. I have seen people, young people say, Hey I'm due for increment. What do you mean you're due for increment? You. You are paid to do a job. You did the jobs. Therefore, that's it, right? But no, I'm entitled to increment because I work three to four months. That sort of mentality is a problem. That's what's your value, right? So you should Feng Shui your brain first, right? You should Feng Shui your alignment to what true value is. So I'm not saying a majority of people like that. So some people at the younger generation, they probably don't see this. And so you have to first define and clarify your true value because when you are using Feng Shui to enhance your income. It is helping [00:38:00] you. It flows better when there is purpose, right? So if you don't know what your purpose and true value is, it's very hard to use Feng Shui to enhance you. 'cause sometimes people are just there trying to make a quick bump. I've seen people like that, right? Then there's this the second thing you need to do is unblock the flow. You need to remove the internal resistance first. There could be sphere fear, scarcity, mindset, and probably a lot of external stagnations. Like for example, you have a lot of old stuff in the house, lot of old boxes and clutter that sort of blocks the flow in Feng Shui, your internal blocks and external blocks that you should. First remove. Okay? Because once you understand that flowing or QI requires flowing of the environment, it's easier to adjust your Feng Shui. Okay? Now we will be talking about aligning alignment with timing [00:39:00] because there's such thing called annual stars in Feng Shui that not every year is processed, but certain years, certain energies at its peak. To align with timing means you need to also take action at those times. If it doesn't, ma, if Feng Shui doesn't match your actual actions in life, you can't benefit from the Feng Shui. You have to take action, okay? And you gotta stay in motion. Qi dies when you stop growing. So keep learning, keep moving, keep creating. A lot of people don't improve themselves. They're, in the job and they're wondering, why don't we get a promotion? The reason you don't get a promotion is because your knowledge state the same Qi dies when you stop growing. So keep learning, keep moving, keep creating. I've seen people young, 21 years old, driven keep on improving and they make a lot of money. 21 to 25. I've seen people at 35 years old making very low [00:40:00] income and they're wondering why they don't get promoted. Only because you ask them. Yeah. How many books do you read? I don't read anything. How do you get knowledge? Oh, I just look at Facebook. So can you understand the, problem that a lot of people don't see where their problem is? So Qi dies when you stop growing. Remember that no matter what you try to activate in Feng Shui. You can activate until the cows come home. But the function will not affect you, only because your internal Qi has died. You stop growing. Okay? And fifth thing is you wanna harmonize with other people, right? Harmonize with others. Wealth, multiplies true connections, relationships, not isolation. Okay? We're designed to live together with people. Think about this. All success comes from the help of other people. Okay. It comes from the help of other people. It [00:41:00] doesn't come because only you did your job. Other people participated in your success. Always remember that. So wealth multiplies when you connect with other people. Okay? So wealth Qi is not something you pursue, it's something that you. You magnetize towards you when your Qi and outer environment are in harmony, especially with the heavens timing, right? All opportunities will flow to you. That's what we are focusing on. Alright, so the internal state, the external space, the timing, and behavioral patterns all disconnect. You will turn. Bad luck to Good luck. All right, so now you understand what Wealth Qi is. Review this lesson. Make sure you understand all this component about what wealth Qi is and when you're ready. I'll see you in the next lesson.\n",
