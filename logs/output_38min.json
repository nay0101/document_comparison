New energy vehicles will  do well with local Government supporting  their use in the public sector. In Singapore, the  Building Materials business should continue  to benefit from high construction demand,  and the Malaysia market will continue to  recover as confidence returns and the credit  environment starts to ease. Cost pressures will  increase, especially energy and labour costs  as the global inflationary environment is here  to stay, and interest rates will remain high  for some time. With our focus on innovation  and productivity enhancements, this will help  to mitigate some of the cost concerns. We  continue to collaborate with our partners and  customers on new energy solutions, and look  to bring innovation to the market. ",

Hence, we will continue to focus our efforts  on reviewing emerging technologies as well  as improve our TCFD reporting framework.  To support these agendas under \u201cBuilding  Resilience for the Long-term\u201d, we will launch  a new Supplier Code of Conduct policy  with our ESG criteria. This will define the  Group\u2019s expectations towards our suppliers  to responsibly manage their ESG issues in  accordance with our standards. It will also  support our plans to embark on Scope 3  emission reporting to expand our greenhouse  gas data coverage. We expect to launch it with  our suppliers over the second half of 2023.",

Based on  the assessment conducted for 2022, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the  IA function and that the IA function has adequate resources and appropriate independent standing  within the Group to perform its functions properly, and the ARC has continually emphasized the  importance of ensuring that the IA function is adequately staffed, especially to handle the review  and testing of controls in key risk areas in the Group\u2019s operations in China.

Prior to the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Group  had commenced the process to research and develop new engine models to comply with the new  engine emission standards as promulgated by the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \u201cDevelopment  Projects\u201d). The efforts to develop such new engines continued during the financial year ended 31  December 2022.  The Group has determined that the Development Projects met the capitalisation  criteria and has capitalised $202.7 million of development expenditure. This includes $37.0 million  capitalised during the year. There was significant management judgement involved in determining  what constitutes development activities, when a project moves from the research phase into the  development phase and what expenses qualify for capitalisation.",

This withholding tax provision does not apply to dividends  paid out of profits earned prior to 1 January 2008. Beginning on 1 January 2008, a 10%  withholding tax is imposed on dividends paid to the Group, as a non-resident enterprise,  unless an applicable tax treaty provides for a lower tax rate and the Group will recognise a  provision for withholding tax payable for profits accumulated after 31\u00a0December 2007 for  the earnings that the Group does not plan to indefinitely reinvest in the PRC enterprises.  As of 31 December 2022, the amount of deferred tax liability recognised in respect of  withholding tax payable was $11,915,000 (2021: $13,903,000).\u00a0\u00a0The amount of unrecognised  deferred tax liability relating to undistributed earnings of the PRC enterprises is estimated to  be $36,746,000 (2021: $41,474,000).",
