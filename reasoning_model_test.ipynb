    "\n",
    "# 1. WORD-BY-WORD COMPARISON:\n",

    "# 2. MULTIPLE DISCREPANCIES PER SENTENCE:\n",
    "#    - A single sentence can contain MULTIPLE discrepancies\n",
    "#    - After finding one difference in a sentence, continue analyzing the same sentence for additional differences\n",
    "#    - Flag EACH difference separately, even if they occur in the same sentence or paragraph\n",

    "**CRITICAL:** This is a highly sensitive legal document analysis. Do not worry about output length - generate ALL discrepancies found, no matter how many there are. Every single mismatch, missing word, spelling error, formatting difference, amount discrepancy, structural variation, or translation inconsistency must be documented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on actual review findings, expect to find dozens of discrepancies including missing brand names, incorrect translations, different numbering systems, wrong amounts, inconsistent terminology, structural differences, AND complex multi-issue clauses where multiple problems exist in single locations. Scan each clause thoroughly - don't stop after finding the first issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BIDIRECTIONAL SCANNING:** Always check BOTH English→BM AND BM→English for missing content. Many discrepancies involve content present in one version but missing in the other. **Pay EXTRA attention to missing translations in the BM version - this is a common issue where English descriptive words are frequently omitted in Bahasa Malaysia translations.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**WORD-LEVEL PRECISION REQUIRED:** Flag ANY missing word, even if the overall sentence meaning is clear. Legal documents require perfect word-for-word accuracy, not just conceptual equivalence. A missing adjective, adverb, or descriptive word must be flagged regardless of whether the sentence still makes sense.\n",
