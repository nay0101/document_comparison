# PART A    OVERVIEW

## 1 Introduction

1.1 As financial products become more diverse and complex to address the varying needs of financial consumers, the ability of financial consumers to understand the features and characteristics to assess product suitability and risks becomes more challenging. Consequently, there is a need to enhance product specific transparency and disclosure to facilitate sufficient understanding by financial consumers so that they can make informed decisions. Given the greater use of financial products, financial consumers need to be provided with relevant, timely, reliable and comparable information that enable them to select financial products that best meet their financial circumstances and needs.

1.2 This Policy Document contains specifications on minimum requirements for enhanced consistency and comprehensive transparency aimed at improving information disclosure on financial products offered by financial service providers ("FSPs").

1.3 This Policy Document sets out the timing and content on disclosure of information on financial products to financial consumers.

1.4 The objectives of this Policy Document are to-

- a) promote financial consumers’ awareness and understanding of financial products offered by FSPs;
- b) ensure consistency in disclosure of essential information on financial products to enable comparison by financial consumers;
- c) minimise mis-selling of financial products and ensure that financial products sold are suitable to the needs and financial circumstances of financial consumers;
- d) promote informed decision-making by financial consumers; and
- e) facilitate financial consumers in safeguarding their own best interests.

## 2 Applicability

2.1 This Policy Document is applicable to FSPs as defined in paragraph 5.2, except for limited purpose e-money issuers (EMIs).

2.2 This Policy Document is applicable to financial products developed or offered by a FSP, either directly or through the FSP’s intermediaries, to individuals, micro and small enterprises (collectively referred to as ‘financial consumers’). FSPs are encouraged to adopt similar disclosure standards for other types of customers. However, the disclosure requirements for Negotiable Instruments of Deposit and Islamic Negotiable Instruments apply to both financial consumers and institutional customers.

2.3 Limited purpose EMIs are encouraged to adopt the disclosure requirements under Schedule III.

# PART B    GENERAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS

This Policy Document specifies minimum requirements on the disclosure of information relating to financial products that must be complied with by a FSP. However, a FSP is expected to adopt higher standards of disclosure, commensurate with the type of financial consumers and the complexity of financial products offered. Any example given in the Policy Document is meant to illustrate and provide clarity on the regulatory expectations and is not intended as the only information that needs to be disclosed to financial consumers.

S The extent to which a standard EMI (as defined under the Policy Document on Electronic Money) implements the requirements under this Policy Document shall be commensurate with the size of the EMI, its customer segments, the nature and complexity of its operations.

# 8 Effective oversight and accountability

## Roles and responsibilities of Board and Senior Management

S 8.1 Executive level commitment and support are critical for effective implementation of sound disclosure practices. Hence, the Board and senior management of a FSP

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=10 -->

| 9 | Key disclosure principles |
| --- | --- |

## S 9.1

A FSP shall give due regard to the information needs of financial consumers by adopting the following disclosure principles-

- (a) timely;
- (b) clear and simple;
- (c) accurate, relevant and sufficient;
- (d) highlight important information; and
- (e) consistent and comparable.

The principles are aimed at improving the quality of disclosure and facilitate comparison and informed decision-making by financial consumers.

[^6]: While the responsibility for developing product disclosure materials may reside with the product development unit, it must seek inputs from other business functions such as marketing, sales and customer services.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=11 -->

## 9.2 Timely disclosure

S 9.2.1 Since financial consumers need information at an early stage to assess the suitability of financial products, a FSP shall ensure that the provision of product information to financial consumers is timely and up-to-date, where applicable, to facilitate informed decision-making by financial consumers.

S 9.2.2 A FSP shall inform financial consumers about a financial product at each of the three stages of the contractual process, i.e. the pre-contractual stage, at the point of entering into a contract and during the term of the contract.

G 9.2.3 Individual notification to financial consumers (whether by written notice or via electronic means) is likely to be more effective in achieving the objective of timely disclosure. However, where such individual notification is impractical or inappropriate on grounds of disproportionate costs, a FSP may adopt one or more of the following alternative means of notification-

- a) statements sent to financial consumers;
- b) prominent display of notices at the FSP’s business premises; or
- c) notices prominently posted on the FSP’s website.

S 9.2.4 When disclosing product information, particularly for information which has an impact on financial consumers’ decision-making[^7], a FSP is required to ensure that the means of notification (whether individual notification or any other means of notification) allows the relevant information to reach the financial consumers in a timely manner.

## 9.3 Clear and simple disclosure

S 9.3.1 Given that provision of excessive information can be counter-productive and confusing to financial consumers, a FSP must ensure that the disclosure on financial products is made in a manner that is concise and fit-for-purpose.

S 9.3.2 A FSP shall present product information in a clear and understandable format by employing methods such as using short and direct sentences, active verbs, clear headings, boldface, key words, tables, diagrams and bullet lists, where appropriate, to improve the clarity of the disclosure.

S 9.3.3 Given that font size is a key factor in determining whether a disclosure is conspicuous, a FSP shall present key product information that is likely to affect financial consumers’ decisions in an easily readable font size and shall not be in a font size smaller than the rest of the contents.

S 9.3.4 A FSP shall ensure contracts, agreements and disclosure documents are written in plain language. The FSP shall avoid the use of legal and technical jargons whenever possible. Where a FSP cannot avoid the use of legal and technical jargons, the FSP shall explain the meaning of these jargons in a footnote in the same page the jargons appear, to help financial consumers understand them.

[^7]: This includes information on the consumer’s rights and obligations as well as the product’s benefits and coverage.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=12 -->

9.3.5 A FSP may consider adopting credible readability tests8 to ensure its contracts, agreements and disclosure documents are written in a manner that is easy for financial consumers to understand.

S 9.3.6 For more complex financial products, a FSP shall simplify and explain product information to financial consumers in a manner which promotes understanding by using appropriate examples or illustrations.

## 9.4 Accurate, relevant and sufficient disclosure

S 9.4.1 A FSP shall disclose accurate, relevant and sufficient information to enable financial consumers to make informed decisions on financial products, including but not limited to product features, benefits and risks, fees and charges, as well as financial consumers’ rights and obligations.

S 9.4.2 Where precise quantitative information cannot be quoted and an estimated figure is provided at the pre-contractual stage, a FSP shall make it clear to financial consumers that the figure is only an estimate and more accurate information will be provided, when available.

S 9.4.3 In ensuring accuracy in disclosure, a FSP must not exaggerate the benefits of financial products. The FSP must ensure that disclosure of product risks shall have equal prominence with information on product benefits. The FSP must disclose information on investment-related products in an objective and unbiased manner, with prospective financial information only included if such information is vital for financial consumers to make an informed decision on the financial product.

S 9.4.4 A FSP shall avoid using hypothetical circumstances or unrealistic assumptions to project future returns which are likely to be misleading. The FSP shall ensure that any projected future return is accompanied by a prominent statement indicating that the information is predictive in nature and may be affected by the underlying assumptions. Where the FSP expresses an opinion, the FSP must ensure that such an opinion is supported by a reasonable basis and the FSP shall unambiguously state that it is a statement of opinion.

S 9.4.5 A FSP shall ensure that graphs and visual illustrations are designed with care to avoid misleading financial consumers.

S 9.4.6 A FSP shall ensure that an investment-related product that merely adopts an investment strategy aimed at returning financial consumers’ capital is not represented as a capital-guaranteed product or any other name that connotes a similar meaning. An investment-related product can only be represented as capital-guaranteed by the FSP if the guarantee is explicitly provided for by the FSP or a third party which is a FSP licensed under the laws administered by BNM.

[^8]: A readability test is an algorithm that scores a text on how easy the text is to understand. The scores are usually based on the number and length of the words and sentences in the text. For example, the Flesch–Kincaid test measures word length and sentence length. The scores range from “very easy to read” to “extremely difficult to read”. The Dall-Chall readability test gauges the comprehension difficulty that readers face when reading a text.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=13 -->

S 9.4.7 For financial products where the funds are invested in Shariah-approved investment instruments, a FSP is prohibited from using any term that could give rise to the perception that they are Islamic or Shariah-compliant products. This includes the use of terms such as “Islamic”, “Shariah”, “Shariah-approved” and “Shariah-compliant”, or Arabic terms or references in the descriptions or names of the financial products or funds of the financial products. This prohibition is not applicable to financial products offered by Islamic banking institutions, takaful operators and a licensed bank or licensed investment bank carrying on Islamic banking business pursuant to BNM’s approval (i.e. Islamic window).

## 9.5 Highlight important information

S 9.5.1 A FSP shall draw financial consumers’ attention to key terms and features of a financial product, which includes but is not limited to the following:

- a) Give due prominence to key product information through the enhancement of presentation, including the use of separate headings, key words, bullet points, boldface, tables, diagrams and infographics;
- b) Highlight major terms and conditions applicable to a financial product such as penalties, restrictions, exclusions, consequences of early termination of contract, financial consumers’ rights and obligations;
- c) Display warnings on a financial product, such as the associated risks, where applicable;
- d) Include a warning that information disclosed on past performance of a financial product is not indicative of future performance, wherever such information is shown; and
- e) Disclose the underlying assumptions and any specific circumstance or condition that may affect future performance of a financial product, where necessary.

S 9.5.2 A FSP shall refer financial consumers to the relevant sources to obtain additional information on a financial product.

## 9.6 Consistent and comparable disclosure

S 9.6.1 A FSP shall disclose product information in a consistent manner to facilitate comparison between similar products offered by the FSP or other FSPs. The FSP shall provide a Product Disclosure Sheet (PDS) to financial consumers to facilitate comparison with similar products offered by the FSP or other FSPs.

## 10 Timing of disclosure

G 10.1 The timing of product disclosure can influence its effectiveness. Disclosure is effective when product information is given to financial consumers at a time that is most relevant to enable the consumers to make informed decisions at each of the three stages of the contractual process, i.e. the pre-contractual stage, at the point of entering into a contract and during the term of the contract.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=14 -->

## 10.2 Pre-contractual disclosure

G 10.2.1 Financial consumers need all relevant information at an early stage in the buying process, particularly before they apply for a specific financial product.

S 10.2.2 At the pre-contractual stage, a FSP shall make sufficient disclosure on a financial product to enable financial consumers to have a basic understanding of the product features, benefits, risks, charges, rights and obligations to facilitate comparison with similar products offered by other FSPs and to make informed decisions.

S 10.2.3 Information that shall be disclosed by a FSP to financial consumers includes but is not limited to-

- a) key features of the financial product;
- b) significant risks associated with the financial product;
- c) benefits to which financial consumers will or may become entitled to, the circumstances in which and times at which those benefits will or may be provided;
- d) applicable fees and charges; and
- e) salient terms and conditions that affect financial consumers’ rights and obligations.

S 10.2.4 A FSP shall make available the pre-contractual disclosure materials, including the PDS on a FSP’s website or other digital channels used to distribute the FSP’s financial products.

G 10.2.5 A FSP may include the following statement to provide prominence on the intent of pre-contractual disclosure: “This page has been designed to help you better understand the financial product you are about to purchase. You are advised to read and understand the information provided.”

## 10.3 Disclosure at the point of entering into a contract

G 10.3.1 “At the point of entering into a contract” refers to the initial stage of financial consumers accepting a financial product offer made by a FSP.

S 10.3.2 A FSP shall provide financial product information in a timely manner before financial consumers enter into a contract with the FSP. This is particularly important in a digital environment whereby the consumers tend to proceed swiftly through an application or purchase process.

S 10.3.3 A FSP shall highlight the key contractual terms and conditions to financial consumers. Information that must be disclosed at this stage includes but is not limited to:

- a) Rights and obligations of the financial consumer and the FSP;
- b) Fees and charges that will be payable by the financial consumer after the acquisition, and when those amounts will be payable;
- c) Cooling-off rights including its duration, if applicable;

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=15 -->

d) Key exclusions, conditions and limits, if applicable; e) Liability for loss, if applicable; and f) Contact details of the FSP and channels for enquiry or complaint.

### S 10.3.4

A FSP shall advise financial consumers to read the PDS and contract, understand the key contractual terms and seek clarification from the FSP should they face any difficulty in understanding any of the contractual terms, prior to entering into the contract.

### S 10.3.5

If financial consumers are required to acknowledge that they have read and understood the terms and conditions disclosed by ticking a box or signing on the PDS, a FSP shall not use such acknowledgement as its sole defence in the event of a dispute between the FSP and the financial consumer in relation to the terms and conditions disclosed in the PDS.

### S 10.3.6

A FSP is prohibited from using pre-ticked boxes in a financial product application form as this tantamount to financial consumers being co-opted into buying a financial product or any additional product without their explicit consent.

![](figure.png)
*Shaded section header: Disclosure during the term of the contract*

## 10.4 Disclosure during the term of the contract

### S 10.4.1

Where applicable, a FSP shall adopt continuous disclosure during the term of a financial product contract through the following methods:

- a) Notice of changes: Any change, including but not limited to the terms and conditions, features of the product and financial consumers’ rights and obligations shall be communicated by a FSP to financial consumers via adequate notices before the changes are introduced. The mode of notification may be in writing via mail or digital means or displayed at the FSP’s business premises or website;
- b) Disclosure on statements: Statements, which include electronic statements, issued at regular intervals for financial products are necessary to communicate important information to financial consumers during the term of the contract. Periodic statements shall be given by a FSP as soon as practicable without any charge to financial consumers. However, for financial products for which physical statements are issued only upon request, the FSP shall ensure that financial consumers have timely access to the information through other channels without any cost; or
- c) Disclosure following a specific request: A FSP shall provide relevant and accurate information as and when requested by financial consumers during the term of the contract. Where a fee may be levied on financial consumers, the FSP shall inform them of the charges and the basis for such charges at the time financial consumers request for the information.

*Shaded section header: Digital disclosure*

## 11 Digital disclosure

### G 11.1

Financial consumers’ poor engagement with financial product disclosure is more pronounced in a digital environment due to peculiarities such as smaller screen size and information overload. The speed and ease of proceeding from the selection process to securing the purchase when transacting digitally can also contribute to financial consumers inadvertently missing important pre-

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=16 -->

contractual disclosure or impede meaningful consideration of product information in their decision-making. The absence of human interaction in the decision-making process heightens the likelihood of financial consumers purchasing a financial product without fully understanding the risks and obligations associated with the product. It is therefore crucial for FSPs to promote effective consumer engagement by enhancing the presentation of product disclosure provided in a digital environment.

### S 11.2

With the growing use of digital channels to offer financial products, a FSP shall ensure that product disclosure is compatible with the digital channel used, whilst ensuring compliance with other disclosure requirements in this Policy Document, particularly the requirements specified under paragraphs 9 and 10.

### S 11.3

A FSP shall ensure that product information disclosed to financial consumers through digital channels is easily accessible, clear and conspicuous to promote consumer engagement and understanding of key product information to facilitate informed decision-making by financial consumers.

### G 11.4

A FSP is encouraged to conduct consumer testing to solicit feedback from financial consumers to ensure product disclosure via digital channels are engaging and easily understood by financial consumers.

### S 11.5

A FSP shall disclose financial product information in a manner that enables financial consumers to print or save a copy of the product information for future reference.

### G 11.6

A good practice for implementation of paragraph 11.5 is to prominently display the download button to draw financial consumers’ attention on the available option to save a digital copy.

### S 11.7

A FSP shall display the PDS prominently on the digital channel to draw financial consumers’ attention to the information. A FSP must not include any promotional information within the same page to avoid diverting financial consumers’ attention away from the PDS.

### S 11.8

A FSP shall ensure that financial consumers cannot proceed to the next stage of the contractual process unless they confirm that they have read the entire PDS. When scrolling is necessary, the FSP shall use appropriate techniques to encourage financial consumers to scroll to view the disclosure.

### G 11.9

Good practices for implementing paragraph 11.8 include using clearly displayed text prompts or visual cues at different parts of the page to convey the importance of reading the PDS and to encourage financial consumers to scroll further to read the PDS.

### S 11.10

A FSP shall ensure that financial product information provided on its digital channels is accurate and up-to-date at the point of disclosure so that financial consumers are able to use such information for making informed decisions.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=17 -->

S 11.11 During the contract term, a FSP shall notify the affected financial consumers of important disclosure on its website or other digital channels in a timely manner using instant communication modes such as SMS or push notification, with details on how to access the disclosure. Notwithstanding, the FSP shall not use hyperlinks in a SMS to direct financial consumers to the disclosure on its website or other digital channels to prevent the risk of financial scams.

S 11.12 When designing financial product disclosure materials for digital channels, a FSP shall pay particular attention to the font size, colour and graphics used to disclose key product information. This is to ensure that these elements enhance the readability and prominence of the product information in relation to other contents displayed on the screen. A FSP must ensure that the disclosure does not include features that draw financial consumers’ attention away from the key product information.

G 11.13 The use of more interactive and engaging methods to improve how key product information is presented would entice financial consumers to read and understand such information. A FSP is encouraged to-

- a) add a “reading time” cue (e.g. it takes less than five minutes to read the PDS);
- b) use interactive tools to help financial consumers understand complex information; and
- c) incorporate digital tools such as a loan or financial calculator.

G 11.14 Good practices to enhance readership and improve understanding include incorporating video or audio to explain complex information, FAQs, warnings on major product risks or short quizzes to assist financial consumers in understanding key terms.

S 11.15 A FSP shall ensure that financial consumers are adequately assisted in their interactions with the FSP in the digital environment by making available a hotline, live chat, chatbot or other interactive tools, proportionate to the complexity of the financial product offered.

G 11.16 For avoidance of doubt, the interactive tools specified under paragraph 11.15 are not necessary if a FSP distributes only simple products, such as deposit accounts, through its digital channel.

S 11.17 For financial products that are offered via a digital channel, a FSP shall clearly inform financial consumers at the point of entering into a contract that they will only receive product disclosure in a digital form[^9] if the FSP does not intend to provide physical copy of the product disclosure.

S 11.18 In relation to financial products offered through non-digital channels, a FSP must consider the profile of affected financial consumers prior to implementing disclosure through only digital mean[^10]. The FSP shall notify financial consumers

[^9]: For the avoidance of doubt, for financial products offered via a digital channel, a FSP is not required to provide a physical copy of the product disclosure.

[^10]: Paragraph 11.18 is applicable when a FSP decides to change the way in which disclosure is communicated to existing customers, i.e. from physical copy to disclosure via digital means only. For example, the FSP will only send soft copy of account statements to the customers.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=18 -->

that disclosure will be made in digital form moving forward and enquire if such change in the form of disclosure is acceptable to the consumers. The FSP shall- a) give prior written notice of at least seven (7) calendar days to financial consumers before the change takes effect; b) in the written notice, indicate the benefits of opting for disclosure via digital means to enable financial consumers to opt-in for migration to digital disclosure; and c) clearly disclose the relevant fees in the event financial consumers request for a physical copy of the information.

# S 11.19

A FSP shall ensure that in making a disclosure via a digital channel, it does not expose financial consumers to heightened security risks, such as phishing, scam, and identity theft.

# S 11.20

When access to relevant financial product information is provided through a hyperlink on a FSP’s digital channels, the FSP shall make it clear that financial consumers will not be asked to provide their personal details online in order to access the product information. This is to mitigate against the risk of phishing and financial scams. The FSP shall also ensure that the hyperlink is- a) prominent and easy to navigate; b) labelled appropriately to convey the relevance of information it leads to; and c) programmed to lead financial consumers directly to the relevant information on the click-through page.

# S 11.21

A FSP shall ensure that any personal information including financial information communicated to financial consumers via a digital channel is adequately protected, such as by using password protection or encryption.

# S 11.22

A FSP shall ensure that its website and other digital channels used to deliver product information are accessible to all financial consumers, consistent with the principles set out in the Policy Document on Fair Treatment of Financial Consumers.

# S 11.23

A FSP that distributes its insurance and takaful products through non-direct digital platforms (NDDPs) 11 shall also comply with the disclosure requirements as specified under paragraph 1 in Schedule II.

# G 11.24

For the avoidance of doubt, the requirements under paragraphs 11.7, 11.8, 11.17 and 11.20 do not apply to NDDPs.

## 12 Disclosure of customer information

# S 12.1

A FSP intending to disclose customer information to other entities within the financial group or third parties such as strategic alliances for marketing and promotional purposes, shall obtain the prior written consent of financial consumers authorising such disclosure.

11 Non-direct digital platforms include product aggregators and E-commerce platforms, but do not include any digital channel developed as the ITO’s proprietary system or outsourced to third party vendors to administer on behalf of the ITO, whereby consumers purchase the product directly from the ITO.

<!-- PAGEBREAK p=19 -->

# S 12.2

For purposes of paragraph 12.1, a FSP that is seeking financial consumers’ consent to disclose their information to another person for marketing and promotional purposes shall comply with the following conditions-

- a) Specific - The FSP shall ensure that the terms providing financial consumers’ consents are clear, concise, and written in plain language. The relevant terms shall be specific in relation to the following:
- b) Voluntary[^13] - The FSP shall not, as a condition of providing a financial product, compel or coerce financial consumers to give their consent for the FSP to disclose their information for marketing and promotional purposes;
- c) Explicit and deliberate - Financial consumers must explicitly opt in or deliberately agree[^14] for the disclosure of their information by the FSP. The FSP is prohibited from obtaining consent using pre-ticked[^15] consent statement; and
- d) Revocable upon request - Financial consumers shall be allowed to withdraw their consent given for the disclosure of their information for marketing and promotional purposes at any time. Financial consumers shall be informed of their rights to withdraw their consent and the means to affect such withdrawal of consent. The process for withdrawing the consent must be as straightforward as it was to obtain the consent, for example via online platforms. The FSP shall cease the disclosure of customer information for marketing and promotional purposes as soon as practicable after the withdrawal of the consent by the financial consumers. A reasonable time frame would be not more than seven (7) calendar days from the day the FSP receives the notification on withdrawal of consent.

1. i. to whom the disclosure will be made[^12];
1. ii. the purpose of such disclosure; and
1. iii. the information that will be disclosed;

# S 12.3

In relation to paragraph 12.2, a FSP shall allow existing financial consumers to withdraw the consents for the disclosure of their information for marketing and promotional purposes, which were given to the FSP prior to the effective date of this Policy Document and the requirement under paragraph 12.2(d) shall apply accordingly.

# S 12.4

From the effective date of paragraph 12, paragraphs 12.1 and 12.2 shall apply to all new financial consumers as well as existing financial consumers when they renew their contracts or apply for a new financial product.

[^12]: It would be sufficient for a FSP to indicate broadly to whom the customer information will be shared for marketing and promotion of financial products, e.g. another entity within the financial group.

[^13]: Consent is not considered as "voluntary" if the consent was secured using a pre-ticked box which requires financial consumers to opt-out of such arrangement.

[^14]: For example, signing a consent form, ticking an opt-in box on paper, or clicking an opt-in button online.

[^15]: A pre-ticked consent box in an application form does not meet the requirement of "explicit and deliberate" consent by financial consumers.

S 16.8 A FSP shall put in place adequate measures to ensure financial consumers are guided to read and understand the PDS prior to entering into a contract. The extent to which the FSP implements these measures shall be commensurate with the complexity of the financial product (i.e. adopting a risk-based approach). The level of measures that must be put in place by FSPs for more complex products would be higher as compared to less complex products. For complex products, the FSP must take additional steps, such as calling customers post-sales, to confirm that the customers are aware of all key terms and risks of the product.

G 16.9 In complying with paragraph 16.8, a FSP may require its front-line sales staff and intermediaries to advise financial consumers to read the PDS and explain the key information in the PDS, such as their obligations and product risks.
